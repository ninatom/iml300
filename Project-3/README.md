About: This project aims to address the exploitation of labor workers and children in Western African and South American countries-specifically within the production of chocolate. I believe this topic is extremely under-acknowledged yet everyone has unconsciously taken some part in this issue or has at one point in their life. Chocolate is undoubtedly one of the most commonly purchased candies, or even product for that matter, yet the reality behind its inhumane production is not discussed or concerned enough by people/consumers. Large chocolate brands like Hershey's, Nestle, Mars, etc, as previously mentioned in the project, take advantage of their power to manipulate the public view. They're able to hide such truths and continuously increase their harmful practices in this industry.------Although this website does not address nearly all the truths surrounding this industry, some information is truly disheartening and just unimaginable- what I have mentioned, though, should in some way at least change the perspective of this industry to some users. This project aims to, of course, spread awareness of this under-acknowledged topic, but also enlighten consumers and encourage them to change their purchasing habits and lean towards 100% cruelty-free products.
