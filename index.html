                    <summary>This week’s readings focus on important topics revolving around the neglect of woman’s acknowledgment in new media and digital art. Cataloguing Change: Women, Art and Technology begins to list and describe many of the involvements female artists have made in the development of early computer-generated art. Although many female artists were the first to accomplish such new ways of expression in an industry categorized as male-dominant, these amazing and progressive digital artworks created by women weren’t as valued compared to male artists. Unfortunately, this issue is a problem still witnessed in today’s society as well as in other creative industries.

                    <summary>This week’s reading was quite interesting as it mentioned certain things about the history of computers as well as the involvement of big tech companies in the industry that I didn’t know about before. The article compares the change from the black to white interfaces of computers to the anti-blackness seen in the market. I don’t know how accurate it is that the transition of the interface was a way for these tech companies to erase or steal poc involvement in the industry, but this analogy does give attention to what kind of people hold power in this industry. Silicon Valley is known for being the hub of high-tech corporations and businesses but is also known to be dominated by white men. These companies received funding from the government and were given the complete freedom to research, discover, and advance at no cost. This gives an unfair advantage to other companies, while these white male-dominated corporations get the most recognition in the industry.

                    <summary>I really liked this week’s reading about the internet as it showed me a different view of the internet that I’ve never seen before. I was introduced to the internet at a fairly young age when it was already pretty advanced and easily accessible. So, seeing what it was like at its beginning in this article was really interesting to read. I honestly can’t imagine what it was like before the internet, not having access to literally all information of the world, or connection to any person, at the tip of your fingers 24/7. But I also can’t really imagine what it was like to experience this randomness and chance conversation. When I started using the internet, I feel like this era was reaching its end. I barely got to experience this, and even though I did a little bit, I was too young to really understand and appreciate it. I definitely agree with Jenny about how this aspect of the internet is gone and I really was hit when she mentioned how young video creators that used to teach you how to do your makeup now try to sell you products because it is definitely something I’ve noticed and is sort of the reason why I don’t appreciate and enjoy the internet as much as I used to.

                    <summary>Lauren McCarthy’s Eyeo talk discusses surveillance and automation in our lives by investigating smart technologies in people’s homes and social media. Her Following Project began when she moved to New York and wanted to explore her new home. She did this by following strangers and documenting what she observed in their lives. While this is a great way to familiarize yourself with an environment you’re new to, this also challenges the privacy of people, especially in such a heavily digitized current world where people don’t get any anymore. Some people find being followed to be invasive and discomforting, but the advancement of technology has created a reality where even in your homes, you're non-consensually being tracked and followed.

                    <summary>This week’s reading, “In Defense of The Poor Image” discusses the correlation between the resolution of images and imperfect cinema. A “poor” image in this reading refers to examples like memes and emphasizes how its easy accessibility and lack of class invalidates its meaning and value. Steryle relates this to the quality of the actual image. The lower the resolution, the more it’s been shared, re-edited, etc.. These images have been remixed and shared so much, the distinction between the audience and author is blurred. Steryle connects this to the imperfect cinema in how they “overcome the divisions of labor within class society.” “Rich” images are those used for commercialization and have high image resolution which Steryle points out we obsess over, which is true.-highlighting the divisions that were blurred by “poor” images.

                    <summary>Joy Buolamwini’s Ted Talk discusses algorithmic bias and its failure to inclusivity. I found this ted talk to be especially compelling because I had never thought how deeply into technology racism and discriminatory practices are embedded- yet code and ar/ai, which uses facial recognition software, is something I use often in my art. She mentions how ai machines don’t recognize faces with darker skin tones and how these algorithms are the same ones that are responsible for identifying suspected criminals. This system is highly flawed and dangerous to society, and joy’s message really helps magnify the unacknowledged root of the issue- the coders.
